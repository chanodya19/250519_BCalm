# BCalm and analyze your MPRA data

BCalm is a package that provides a modification from [the mpralm package](https://github.com/hansenlab/mpra/tree/master), an R package that provides tools for differential analysis in MPRA studies.  
BCalm allows users to use individual barcodes as model input.  
See the vignette for examples on how to run BCalm.  

BCalm requires R >=3.5, <= 4.4.0 and can be installed using `devtools` or `remotes`.
